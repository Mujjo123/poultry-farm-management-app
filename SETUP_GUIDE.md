service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /transactions/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Publish"

### Step 4: Create Admin User

You need to create an admin user account. You have two options:

#### Option A: Using Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Go to **Authentication > Users** in Firebase Console
2. Click "Add User"
3. Enter email: `admin@mujawarpoultry.com`
4. Enter password: `Admin@123` (or your choice)
5. Click "Add User"

#### Option B: Using the App (First Time Only)

Temporarily modify the app to create an admin account:

1. In `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`, add a signup button
2. Run the app and create the admin account
3. Remove the signup button after creating the account

### Step 5: Configure Android Permissions

The `AndroidManifest.xml` is already configured with necessary permissions:
- SEND_SMS (for sending SMS notifications)
- READ_SMS / RECEIVE_SMS (optional, for SMS verification)
- INTERNET (for Firebase connectivity)
- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (for backup exports)

### Step 6: Build and Run

#### For Development (Debug Mode)

```bash
flutter run
```

#### For Production (Release APK)

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be generated at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## üì± SMS Configuration

### Option 1: Android SmsManager (Default - Free)

The app uses native Android SMS functionality. No additional setup required.

**Requirements:**
- Physical Android device (SMS doesn't work on emulator)
- SMS permission granted at runtime

### Option 2: Twilio API (Optional - Paid)

For cloud-based SMS or iOS support:

1. Create account at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token
3. Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number
```

4. Modify `lib/services/sms_service.dart` to use Twilio API

## üß™ Testing the App

### Login Credentials

Use the admin credentials you created:
- **Email**: `admin@mujawarpoultry.com`
- **Password**: `Admin@123`

### Test Flow

1. **Login** with admin credentials
2. **Add Transaction**:
   - Customer Name: Test Customer
   - Mobile: 9876543210
   - Quantity: 5
   - Kilogram: 10
   - Rate: 150
   - Paid Amount: 1000
3. **Check if SMS is sent** (requires physical device)
4. **View Dashboard** statistics
5. **View Transaction History**
6. **Export Backup** (Excel/JSON/CSV)

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Change default admin password** immediately
2. **Update Firestore security rules** for production
3. **Enable Firebase App Check** (optional)
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
5. **Regular database backups**

---

## üì¶ Building for Production

### 1. Update App Version

In `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0+1
```

### 2. Generate App Icon (Optional)

Use [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/) to create icons

### 3. Create Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

This creates optimized APKs for different CPU architectures:
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (32-bit ARM)
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (64-bit ARM)
- `app-x86_64-release.apk` (64-bit x86)

### 4. Test Release Build

```bash
flutter install --release
```
